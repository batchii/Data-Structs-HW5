Basically our program works by first generating a graph of all the vertices and 
makes edges between things that are next to each other in the order.  This becomes the 
result that we have. 

This program reads in the dictionary and does a bunch of things.
It reads two words at a time, and compares them, character by character, 
until a difference is found between them.  Once a difference is found, the program
automatically assumes that the character in the first word will be less than the value
in the second word.  This establishes the order.  Then it adds them as vertices to a graph
and a directed edge from the first letter to the second letter.  If a vertex has already been
created, and if it already has an edge, that edge will be replaced by the new edge, because
that is how we thought it could work. Finally it will output the order in a char array back to 
the program.

Finally we sort the words and output them to a file.
